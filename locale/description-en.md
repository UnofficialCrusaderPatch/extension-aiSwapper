# AI Swapper

**Authors**: TheRedDaemon, gynt  
**Version**: 1.1.0  
**Repository**: Part of [https://github.com/UnofficialCrusaderPatch/UnofficialCrusaderPatch3](https://github.com/UnofficialCrusaderPatch/UnofficialCrusaderPatch3)

This module allows to swap individual AI slots without restrictions. This includes placing an AI in any slot without message problems. It allows further to use individual videos for every voice line and supports localization.

Support is currently only guaranteed for the western versions of Crusader 1.41 and Crusader Extreme 1.41.1-E. Since it interacts with locales, other version are unlikely to function, but were not tested yet.

### Options

The module provides a custom menu which allows to configure the individual AI slots by adding AIs provided via active plugins that include AI resources.  Multiple AIs can be added per slot and it is possible to set individual parts to "active", "ignored" or "deactivated". The latter basically tells the UCP that vanilla should be used, while "ignored" falls through to the next resource.  
The priority order of user added AIs can be changed and the first AI in the list has the highest priority.
